The design pattern that we want to match must satisfy these properties:

    1) The string begins with a capital letter
    2) The string ends with a one one the three punctuation marks .!?
    3) In between are 1 or more lower case letters

Example matching patterns:

    Aezgh.   (denote as a match6)
    Ha?      (denote as a match3)
    Xxxx?    (denote as a match5)

Example of string that don't contain a match

    abcAbx   (denote as a miss6)
    abc      (denote as a miss3)
    xgH.     

Strings that are not matches and don't contain a match are misses.

Let pmatch(N) be the probability that a string of length is a match.

   Then pmatch(N) = (3/55) * (26/55) ^ (N-1)
   Note that N if < 3 by definition

What is the probability that a string has length N but does not contain a matching design pattern?
The probability is less that N


What is the probability that a letter belongs to a pattern of length N or a non-pattern of length N


Let the alphabet be all lower and upper case letters and three punctuation marks.

The probability of a match3 is 0.012189 = (26/55)*(26/55)*(3/55)
The probability of a match4 is 0.005762 = (26/55)*(26/55)*(26/55)*(3/55)
The probability of a match5 is 0.002724
The probability of a match6 is 0.001288
The probability of a match7 is 0.000609


Suppose you have a miss of length 2 or more. What is the probability that is you add a character is will still be a miss?

pmiss(1) = 1
pmiss(2) = 1
pmiss(3) = 1 - pmatch(3)
pmiss(4) = pmiss(3) 


let pattern(N) be a string of N lower case letters followed by an upper case letter. The probability of pattern(N) is

(26/55)^(N+1). 

suffix probability




pmiss(N) = (1-0.012189) ^ (N-2) where N >= 3
